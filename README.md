## Project 1: A "data story" on how Americans vote


### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2021

+ Project title:  Which defining characteristic gives the most uniform voting outputs?
+ This project is conducted by Serena Yuan

+ Project summary: 
The main question in this data story is: which characteristics of the voter should be used in the future to predict who they vote for in the future? 

In other words, in which categories are there more differences in voting preference, and in which categories are there less differences in voting preference?

This can help those running in the future to know which communities to target and which communities based on identity, region, or work status, to rely on for votes.


We experiment in answering this question by dividing characteristics into three relevant groups.

We experiment by faceting by different characteristics. This helps us understand which characteristics of voters lead to voting for various parties, when given a constraint.
